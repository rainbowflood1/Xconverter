# Xinverter
Xinverter converts your applacation to DirectX9 so that it can be accessible to Xbox360
# How it works
It mimics the DirectX12 library, and runs DirectX9 functions
# How to set it up
To set it up, duplacate your project file, download the Xinverter, include the library into your project, then replace the DirectX12 library with "xconverter.h"
#Limitations
Features like Ray tracing will have a function, but does nothing because older hardware isn't designed to run Ray Tracing
